## Design

### Flowchart:

I made a flowchart for the project to plan out my code structure using [Lucid](https://rb.gy/7i0nms)

![Flowchart](assets/readme_images/flowchart.png)

<!-- ### Colour Scheme:

The primary enhancement to the game from its original version is the inclusion of themed color palettes for the tiles. Key colors such as purple, orange, blue, and red have been carefully curated for this purpose. In the light mode, gentle and muted hues of these colors were chosen to create a soothing visual experience for players.

Conversely, in the dark mode, deeper and richer shades of purple and blue were implemented to cater to players who prefer a very dark background. This contrasts with the darker tones of orange and red, which offer a touch of brightness to the dark-mode interface without being overly intense. The goal was to provide options for players with varying preferences regarding the darkness of the background.

Throughout both light and dark modes, the emphasis was placed on avoiding excessively bright or harsh colors that could strain the player's eyes. By maintaining a balance between aesthetics and visual comfort, the game aims to enhance the overall gaming experience for players, regardless of their chosen mode.

##### Light Mode:

##### Dark Mode:

### Typography:

Using the default "Arial" font for the game was a deliberate choice to maintain simplicity and clarity in the overall design. By opting for a widely recognized and easy-to-read font like Arial, the focus remains on the gameplay itself without introducing unnecessary distractions or complexities.

The decision to avoid excessive styling aligns with the goal of keeping the game's appearance clean and neat. Arial's straightforward and legible characteristics ensure that players can quickly interpret the text elements within the game interface without any hindrance. This approach fosters a seamless user experience, where players can engage with the game effortlessly without being overwhelmed by unnecessary design flourishes.

> "The aesthetics of the website should be simple and neat to avoid any distractions from the gameplay."

#### Game Area:
The game area consists of grid of tiles in which the user can enter the letters to guess the word. The color of the tiles can be changed by choosing a color in the themes menu. The background of the game area will be changed between black and half-white according to dark and light mode.
Apart from this the tiles also performs various animations and shows alert messages as follows.

![Game Area](documentation/game-area.png)

#### Flip Animation:
When the user enters a valid guess, the tiles in the game area perform a flipping animation to visually indicate the validation of the guess. The game then proceeds to validate the guess against the correct answer. Based on this validation, each tile receives a class that determines its color and visual representation:

- **Green Tiles**: Tiles representing letters that are present in the word and in the correct position are assigned a class that gives them a green color. This indicates that the user has guessed these letters correctly.

- **Yellow Tiles**: Tiles representing letters that are present in the word but not in the correct position are assigned a class that gives them a yellow color. This indicates that the user has guessed these letters correctly but in the wrong position.

- **Grey Tiles**: Tiles representing letters that are not present in the word are assigned a class that gives them a grey color. This indicates that the user has guessed these letters incorrectly.

By assigning these classes and colors to the tiles, the game provides clear visual feedback to the user, helping them understand the correctness of their guess and guiding them in subsequent attempts. Additionally, the flipping animation adds a engaging element to the gameplay experience, enhancing user immersion and enjoyment.

> "Adding fun animations keeps the gameplay engaging and interesting."

![Flip Animation](documentation/flip.gif)

#### Shake Animation:
If a word not in the list of valid words for gameplay is entered by the user, the tiles in the game area respond with a shake animation to indicate an invalid guess. This visual cue helps users recognize that their input does not match any valid words in the game's vocabulary, prompting them to try another word.

> "Adding fun animations keeps the gameplay engaging and interesting."

![Shake Animation](documentation/shake.gif)

#### Dance Tile Animation:
When the user guesses the correct word, the tiles perform a dance animation, celebrating the user's victory. This animated display adds a touch of excitement and reward to the gameplay experience, reinforcing the user's success and creating a positive interaction with the game.

- When the user correctly guesses the word, an alert message appears saying "Congratulations, You win." to celebrate the user's victory.

- If the user is unable to guess the word after 6 attempts, an alert message displays "Oops.. You missed it.. The correct word is ' [correct word] '." This informs the user of the correct word, providing closure to the game round.

These alert messages assist the user by providing feedback and guidance throughout the gameplay, ensuring a smoother and more engaging experience.

### Bugs:
##### Tile Color Change Bug: 
Initially, the tiles were not changing colors after flipping when different themes were set. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the respective color theme classes were not added to the tiles in the CSS. Adding these classes resolved the issue.

##### Overlay Effect Disappearance: 
The overlay effect applied to the "How to Play" and "Statistics" modals disappeared when clicking anywhere inside the modals. Assigning different overlay classes to each modal solved this problem, ensuring the overlay effect remained intact.

##### Close Button Dysfunctionality: 
On smaller screens, the close button in the "How to Play" modal was not functioning properly. Increasing the z-index of the modal resolved this issue, allowing users to close the modal seamlessly.

##### Unintended Modal Opening: 
While the themes menu was open, users could click on other icons and open additional modals without closing the themes menu. To address this bug, a transparent overlay was created to block access to other icons when the themes menu is open, ensuring proper behavior.

##### Theme and Mode Reset Bug: 
Themes and modes were reverting to default settings upon page reset. Implementing local storage to save theme and mode selections ensured that these preferences persisted across page resets.

##### Flash of White Background: 
When the reset icon was pressed in dark mode, there was a brief flash of white background. This issue was debugged by moving the theme reset code to the top of the HTML, eliminating the flash of white background upon reset.

These bug fixes and debugging efforts contribute to a smoother and more seamless user experience, ensuring that the game functions as intended across different scenarios and interactions.

### Unfixed Bugs:
- There is no unfixed bugs to my knowledge.
